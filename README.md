# Modern Calculator App

A modern calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, state management, and event handling, while also experimenting with modern UI design using gradients and glassmorphism.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Animated gradient background with glassmorphism calculator shell
- Operator chaining (e.g., `7 + 3 + 2`)
- Repeated equals support (`7 + 3 = 10`, pressing `=` again = 13, then 16, etc.)
- Decimal handling (prevents duplicate decimals, supports `0.` after operators)
- Clear button with AC/CE toggle:
  - AC = All Clear (resets all state)
  - CE = Clear Entry (resets only current input)
- Operator highlighting (`.is-depressed` state)  
- Smooth hover and click effects for buttons
